  //The real question is how would we fetch, or graphql real data into a reach project?

  //Next 3 entries: Setting state
  //useState below is a React Hook function word
//useState  is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that 
//this.state provides in a class. The only argument to the 
//useState() Hook is the initial state. Unlike with classes, the state
//doesnâ€™t have to be an object. What does useState return? 
//It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that 
//updates it.This is why we write const [count, setCount] = useState().
//This is similar to this.state.count and this.setState in a class, 
//except you get them in a pair.  
//[users, setUsers] below are not React words - use any words that make sense to you
//we have initialized the state users with (usersData), in Hook
// documentation they use the 2nd returned item (setUsers) in my case
// as a function. not doing that here, but it does show up in 
// each CRUD operation below   
const [users, setUsers] = useState(usersData)
  //see and update current user being edited, so apply empty
  //user to a currentUser state:
const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(initialFormState)
//make state for edit mode:
const [editing, setEditing] = useState(false)



//CRUD operations:
  const addUser = user => {
    //I'm not sure where id comes from in the next line
    user.id = users.length + 1
    //and then user becomes the 2nd returned item?
    setUsers([...users, user])
  }

  const deleteUser = id => {
    //ok, so setEditing is the 2nd returned item, what is 
    //this doing again? setting it to false
    setEditing(false)

    setUsers(users.filter(user => user.id !== id))
  }

  const updateUser = (id, updateUser) => {
    setEditing(false)

    setUsers(users.map(user => (user.id === id ? updateUser : user)))
  }

//editRow function should turn on edit mode and set current user
//when edit is selected on a user:
const editRow = user =>{
  setEditing(true)
